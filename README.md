This is the email component for the [Asinius library](https://github.com/robsheldon/asinius-core).

## Status

This is pretty rough still. There are some good parts here, but a lot is still missing. There's not yet any parsing of attachments or multipart messages, UTF8 parsing, or parsing of the plethora of headers that emails might have, among other things.

It's a start and that's about it.
